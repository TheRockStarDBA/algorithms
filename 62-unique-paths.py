A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the
diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is
trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28 """

# Approach: Dynamic Programming

# We have a dp[i][j] represents  how many paths from [0][0] to current location.
#     dp[i][j] =  1  if i==0 or j==0        //the first row/column only have 1 uniqe path.
#              =  dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]   //the path can be from my top cell and left cell.
